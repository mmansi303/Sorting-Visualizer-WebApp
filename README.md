# Sorting Visualization
### This is a simple Sorting Visualizer WebApp made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Following sorting techniques are mentioned in this project.
### - Bubble Sort
### - Selection Sort
### - Insertion Sort
### - Quick Sort
### - Merge Sort

### We have learnt various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort. But we often fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization. Thatâ€™s why I have made this project to let everyone understand how these algorithms work and through this project you also will get a deep understanding of such sorting algorithms.

### This whole project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
